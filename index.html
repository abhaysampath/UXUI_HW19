                            <h4 class="modalSectionHead">About the Project</h4>
                            <p>The goal of this project was to re-design a non-profit website with 
                                the user experience in mind. Our team selected Farm Animal Rescue 
                                of Maine after noticing that they had a lot of information for display, 
                                but had organized it all into single long pages. </p>
                            <p>We decided to reorganize the website to divide the posts into smaller 
                                pages accessible through menus. This helped users that knew where they 
                                wanted to go navigate to their destination quickly, while also giving 
                                users that wanted to browse the non-profit's offerings an informative 
                                landing page to start on and start exploring from.</p>
                            <div class="modalPic1">

                            <h4 class="modalSectionHead">Tasks and Challenges</h4>
                            <p>Website needs an aesthetic design and a call to action. It doesn't 
                                provide users with enough information to plan their trip, which is 
                                causing them to choose other destinations</p>
                            <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                            <p>Adobe Xd: Create prototype</p>
                            <p>Google Forms: Create Survey, Collect Data</p>
                            <p>Miro: Brainstorming, Gathering, Sorting Data</p>

                            <h4 class="modalSectionHead">Research Methodology</h4>
                            <p>Conducted phone and online surveys to gather data about why people 
                                visit farms and what data they are looking for on the farmâ€™s website. 
                                Analyzed 4 other farm websites to find strengths, weaknesses, 
                                opportunities, and threats.</p>
                            <p>Compiled survey results to find specific areas for improvement. 
                                Created a User Persona with specific behavioral demographics, 
                                needs, goal, and pain points.</p>
                            <p>Used the persona we created to create a user journey and drew storyboards. 
                                Reorganized the website sitemap to organize information into menus and submenus.</p>
                                
                            <h4 class="modalSectionHead">User Experience Storyboard</h4>
                            <div class="modalPic2">

                            <h4 class="modalSectionHead">Wireframing & Prototyping</h4>
                            <p>Using the updated sitemap, we created lo-fi wireframes, then iterated the design
                                with further testing and developed a clickable high-fidelity prototype starting 
                                with the site navigation.
                            </p>
                            <p>The prototypes focused on two main tasks:</p> 
                            <p>        1) Registering for the farm camp</p>
                            <p>        2) Donating to the animal rescue nonprofit.</p>
